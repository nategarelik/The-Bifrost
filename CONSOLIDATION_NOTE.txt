MCP Server Consolidation (2024-01-06)
=====================================

This directory originally contained three MCP server implementations:
1. MCPServer.cs - Basic implementation
2. MCPServerEnhanced.cs - Enhanced version with better features
3. SimpleMCPServer.cs - TCP-based fallback

We consolidated to a single MCPServer.cs (formerly MCPServerEnhanced) because:
- WebSocket is the standard transport for MCP protocol
- Multiple implementations were confusing and redundant
- The enhanced version had all necessary features
- websocket-sharp.dll is included for proper WebSocket support

The consolidated MCPServer provides:
- Full MCP 2024-11-05 specification compliance
- WebSocket transport via websocket-sharp
- Dynamic tool/resource registration
- Event-based client management
- Thread-safe operation execution

All references have been updated throughout the codebase.
