Here is a **detailed, high-level design/requirements markdown file** for a next-generation, AI-powered Unity MCP server and game automation system. This is written for a powerful LLM like Claude, giving it creative freedom to design the most robust, extensible, and efficient system possible, while ensuring all features and design goals are covered.

# ü¶Ñ Bifrost: Next-Gen Unity MCP Game Factory ‚Äì Design & Requirements

## Overview

**Bifrost** is a fully automated, AI-driven Unity game development platform, exposing the entire Unity Editor and game creation workflow as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It enables local or remote LLM agents (including local models via Ollama) to design, build, test, and iterate on complete, Steam-publishable games with minimal human intervention.

The system is designed for:

- **Maximum agent autonomy** (agents can reason, plan, and execute with minimal user prompts)
- **Full Unity Editor and 3D scene awareness**
- **Efficient, cost-optimized LLM usage**
- **Extensibility and modularity** (easy to add new tools, resources, and AI providers)
- **Robust error handling and observability**
- **UPM compatibility and modern Unity best practices**

---

## Core Features

### 1. **MCP Server Foundation**

- **WebSocket-based MCP server** using a modern, Unity-friendly library (e.g., NativeWebSocket or Cysharp/websocket-sharp via UPM)
- **Implements the latest @context7 MCP spec** (JSON-RPC 2.0, version negotiation, tool/resource registry)
- **Dynamic tool/resource registration** (all available tools/resources are discoverable at runtime)
- **Async, non-blocking, and thread-safe Unity integration**

### 2. **LLM Provider Abstraction**

- **Pluggable LLM providers** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama/local, etc.)
- **Ollama integration** for local LLMs (configurable endpoint/model)
- **Provider selection UI** in the Unity Editor
- **Automatic cost optimization** (batching, context window management, minimal token usage for routine tasks)
- **Streaming and non-streaming LLM support**

### 3. **Unity Game Factory Tools**

- **Scene and asset management:** create, modify, delete scenes, GameObjects, prefabs, materials, scripts, etc.
- **Component and property manipulation:** add/remove components, set/get any property, support for custom MonoBehaviours
- **Asset pipeline:** import, generate, and manage assets (models, textures, audio, etc.)
- **Script/code generation:** create and update C# scripts, attach to objects, hot-reload support
- **Build automation:** trigger builds for any platform (stub for now, extensible for Steam/console)
- **Playmode and editmode test execution**
- **Console and log access:** send/read logs, errors, warnings
- **Full scene hierarchy/resource introspection:** agents can query and reason about the entire project and scene state

### 4. **AI/Agent Autonomy**

- **Minimal user prompting/check-ins:** agents are trusted to plan, execute, and iterate with little human intervention
- **Full 3D scene awareness:** agents can query, analyze, and reason about spatial relationships, object interactions, and game logic
- **Game design context:** agents have access to design docs, genre conventions, and can synthesize new mechanics or content
- **Plan validation and fallback:** agents validate their own plans, recover from errors, and optimize for efficiency and cost

### 5. **Editor & User Experience**

- **Modern, tabbed EditorWindow UI:** Chat, MCP Server, Tools, Debug, Settings, Prompt Library, etc.
- **Live status and logs:** show connected clients, tool/resource registry, recent actions, errors
- **Prompt library and onboarding:** quick-start templates, documentation, and usage guides
- **Settings UI:** configure LLM providers, Ollama endpoint/model, cost controls, etc.

### 6. **Extensibility & Modularity**

- **Easy to add new tools/resources:** clear interfaces and registration patterns
- **ScriptableObject-based config where appropriate**
- **All code organized by feature/domain (MCP, AI, GameGen, UI, etc.)**
- **UPM-compatible, clean dependencies**

### 7. **Observability & Error Handling**

- **Comprehensive logging:** all actions, errors, and agent decisions are logged and queryable
- **Agent self-diagnostics:** agents can report their own status, errors, and suggestions for improvement
- **Graceful error recovery:** failed actions are retried or alternative plans are generated

### 8. **Token/Cost Optimization**

- **Batching and context management:** minimize LLM calls for routine or repetitive tasks
- **Summarization and memory:** agents can summarize context to reduce token usage
- **User-configurable cost controls:** set max tokens, batch sizes, or provider preferences

## Design Principles

- **Agent-first:** The system is designed for autonomous, creative, and context-aware agents. Human intervention is minimal and optional.
- **Full Unity coverage:** Every Unity Editor operation is available as an MCP tool or resource.
- **Extensible and future-proof:** Easy to add new features, tools, and providers.
- **Efficient and robust:** Optimized for speed, cost, and reliability.
- **No blockers:** The system should never get ‚Äústuck‚Äù or require unnecessary user input. Agents are empowered to resolve issues and continue progress.

---

## Example Use Cases

- **‚ÄúGenerate a complete 3D platformer game with 5 levels, a main menu, and basic enemy AI.‚Äù**
- **‚ÄúIterate on the current scene to add more environmental detail and optimize lighting.‚Äù**
- **‚ÄúImport these assets from a URL and use them to populate the level.‚Äù**
- **‚ÄúBuild and test the game for Windows and report any errors.‚Äù**

---

## Implementation Notes

- **Let the LLM/agent be creative and liberal in its choices**‚Äîthe system should enable, not restrict, powerful automation and design.
- **All Unity and MCP best practices should be followed.**
- **No feature or design goal should be omitted.**
- **The system should be robust enough that no issues arise during automated game development.**
